# Google Book Quest

## Introduction 📘

Google Book Quest is a dynamic application designed to satiate the appetites of avid readers searching for new literature. It leverages the power of the MERN stack alongside GraphQL with Apollo Server to provide a seamless and performant experience, allowing users to save their favorite book searches and maintain a list for future reading.

## Project Overview 🌍

Transitioned from a RESTful API to a more modern GraphQL API, this application stands as a testament to the evolving demands of web development. The refactoring to Apollo Server ensures data is fetched and modified efficiently, meeting the high standards of modern user expectations.

### Objectives 🎯

- Enable robust book searching using the Google Books API.
- Provide a personalized experience by allowing users to save book searches.
- Enhance performance by transitioning from RESTful API practices to GraphQL API.

## Technical Stack 🛠️

- **React**: For a dynamic and responsive front-end.
- **GraphQL**: To handle queries and mutations effectively.
- **Apollo Server**: To connect the React front end with the GraphQL API.
- **MongoDB**: As the database to store user data and book searches.
- **Node.js/Express.js**: For the server and API.

## Features 🌟

- Search for books via the Google Books API.
- User authentication for personalized experiences.
- Save and manage a personal book list.
